Welcome to the **SQL Analytics** repository, a collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analysis, and report generation, focused on **customer, product, and sales metrics**.  

This project leverages the gold layer created in the [SQL Data Warehouse](https://github.com/paula-chidiac/sql-data-warehouse/tree/main) project but also provides a script to build everything from scratch for reproducibility.
